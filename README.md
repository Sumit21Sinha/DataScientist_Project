## ML (Data Analyst) Project

# PROJECT SUMMARY
This project focuses on building a predictive model for GDP growth rate using publicly available macroeconomic indicators from the World Bank Open Data. Instead of analyzing a single country, the scope has been expanded to include multiple countries across the globe. The dataset will consist of country-level indicators such as inflation rate, poverty headcount ratio, unemployment rate, and current GDP (constant USD). These will serve as input features to predict the GDP growth rate (annual %). By creating a global panel dataset covering multiple years (2000–2023), the project aims to analyze trends across regions, identify the most influential economic factors, and forecast GDP growth for different countries. This global approach makes the project more comprehensive and realistic, offering valuable insights into international economic performance and growth drivers.

# OBJECTIVE
The main objectives of this project are:
- To collect, clean, and preprocess global macroeconomic data from the World Bank.
- To construct a panel dataset (Country × Year × Indicators) covering the years 2000–2023.
- To identify key macroeconomic factors influencing GDP growth across countries.
- To build predictive models for GDP growth using inflation, poverty, unemployment, and GDP as inputs.
- To compare trends between developed and developing countries.
- To generate visualizations highlighting global and regional economic patterns.

# TOOLS/LIBRARIES
The following Python libraries and tools will be used in the project:
- pandas → For data collection, cleaning, and manipulation.
- numpy → For numerical computations and handling arrays.
- matplotlib / seaborn → For creating visualizations of global trends.
- scikit-learn → For regression and machine learning-based prediction models.
- statsmodels → For advanced statistical and econometric analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook / PyCharm → As development environments for coding and analysis.
